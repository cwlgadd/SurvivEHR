# CPRD
Datasets for the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Designed for Optimal and Mum-Predict research packages

## Description

This sub-module builds a deep-learning friendly tabular dataset for CPRD in polars. This remains a memory efficient (and maximum token length agnostic) representation.

Long term, it may be worth pre-processing the tokenization and padding steps here to reduce run-time compute.

## Function

TODO: fill
